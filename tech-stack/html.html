                    Language
                    (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
                and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
                render
                them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included
                cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:15px;">HTML elements are the buling blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
                and
                other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to
                create
                structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                links,
                quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
