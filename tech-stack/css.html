                is a
                style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
                such as
                HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of
                the
                World
                Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.
                This
                separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
                of
                presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
                CSS
                in a
                separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
                .css
                file
                to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
